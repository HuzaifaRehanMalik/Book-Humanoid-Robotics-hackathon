# APA Citation Guidelines for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## General APA Format

For this textbook, all citations must follow the 7th edition of the American Psychological Association (APA) style guide. This ensures consistency and academic rigor throughout the content.

## In-Text Citations

### Single Author
- Parenthetical: (Author, Year) - e.g., (Smith, 2023)
- Narrative: Author (Year) - e.g., Smith (2023) states that...

### Multiple Authors
- Two authors: (Author1 & Author2, Year) - e.g., (Smith & Jones, 2023)
- Three to 20 authors: (Author1 et al., Year) - e.g., (Smith et al., 2023)
- More than 21 authors: List first 19, then ellipsis, then last author

### No Date
- Use (Author, n.d.) when no date is available

## Citation Examples in Textbook Context

### When citing foundational robotics concepts:
The potential field method, originally developed by Khatib (1986), remains a fundamental approach for robot navigation.

### When citing recent research:
Recent advances in reinforcement learning for robotics have shown promising results (Levine et al., 2023).

### When citing textbooks for foundational knowledge:
For a comprehensive overview of robot kinematics, readers are referred to the foundational work by Craig (2005).

## Notes
- Always include DOI when available
- Use sentence case for article titles, title case for journal names
- For online sources, include retrieval date if the content is likely to change over time
- When citing multiple sources for a single statement, order them chronologically or alphabetically by first author's surname
- For direct quotes, always include page or paragraph numbers (Author, Year, p. #) or (Author, Year, para. #) for online sources without page numbers

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Missing DOI or URL for online sources
- Incorrect capitalization in titles
- Missing publisher information
- Inconsistent formatting between references
- Mixing different citation styles within the same document
